    <h2>What is Oyakodon?</h2>
    <p>
      Oyakodon, literally "parent-and-child donburi", is a Japanese rice bowl
      dish, in which chicken, egg, sliced scallion and other ingredients are
      simmered together in a sweet-salty sauce made with dashi, soy sauce, and
      mirin and served on a bed of steamed rice. The name of the dish is a
      poetic reflection of both chicken and egg being used in the dish.
