    <h2>What is Oyakodon?</h2>
    <p>
      Oyakodon, literally "parent-and-child donburi", is a Japanese rice bowl
      dish, in which chicken, egg, sliced scallion and other ingredients are
      simmered together in a sweet-salty sauce made with dashi, soy sauce, and
      mirin and served on a bed of steamed rice. The name of the dish is a
      poetic reflection of both chicken and egg being used in the dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ onion</li>
      <li>283g boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>3-4 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the Seasonings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>120ml dashi</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For Serving</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 servings of cooked rice</li>
      <li>4 thinly sliced green onions</li>
      <li>shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Seasonings</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine the dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a bowl or a liquid
        measuring cup and mix all together until the sugar is dissolved.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Slice the onion lengthwise, about ¼ inch wide.</li>
      <li>Chop the green onions ½ inch wide.</li>
      <li>
        Trim the extra bits of fat and connective tissue from the chicken with
        the knife.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the chicken thigh along the grain into strips ¾ to 1 inch (2-2.5 cm)
        wide. Next, angle your knife back and diagonally (nearly parallel to the
        cutting board), and then slice the chicken strips against the grain into
        pieces of about ¾ to 1 inch squares.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a bowl or tray and sprinkle with the sake. Set
        aside for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a bowl. Using a pair of chopsticks, lift the egg
        whites to "cut" them 5-6 times into a few smaller clumps. This will
        prevent the egg whites from falling into the frying pan all at once. Do
        not whisk or beat the eggs together.
      </li>
      <li>
        While "cutting" the egg whites, you may have accidentally broken some of
        the egg yolks. That's okay. If the yolks haven't broken yet, you can
        poke them to gently break them, but do not blend the egg whites and
        yolks.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cook the Oyakodon in a Medium Frying Pan</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan in a
        single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover the
        onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering, add
        the chicken on top of the onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once simmering
        again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for
        <strong>5 minutes</strong> or until the chicken is no longer pink and
        the onions are tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        We will add the eggs in <strong>two stages</strong>: Two-thirds of the
        eggs first, then the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat
        to medium. With the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the
        edges), drizzle two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the
        chicken and onions, <strong>avoiding the edges</strong> of the pan where
        the eggs can easily overcook. Also, try to add more egg whites at this
        stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally, we
        want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward
        the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the heat
        is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg whites
        are taking a long time to set.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs to
        the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the green onion on top
        and cook on medium low until the egg is done to your liking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked chicken
        and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired amount of
        pan sauce on top.
      </li>
    </ol>
