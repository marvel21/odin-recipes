    <h2>What is all'amatriciana?</h2>
    <p>
      Named after Amatrice, a mountain town in Lazio, Amatriciana is one of the
      region's most famous pasta dishes. It is a quick and easy make pasta dish,
      but it must be cooked with care and attention.

    <p>
      This classic sauce takes its spiciness from black pepper and dried chiles
      and its depth of flavor from guanciale, Italian salt-cured pork jowl. If
      you can't find it, use pancetta, which is available at better
      supermarkets.
