    <h2>What is all'amatriciana?</h2>
    <p>
      Named after Amatrice, a mountain town in Lazio, Amatriciana is one of the
      region's most famous pasta dishes. It is a quick and easy make pasta dish,
      but it must be cooked with care and attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      This classic sauce takes its spiciness from black pepper and dried chiles
      and its depth of flavor from guanciale, Italian salt-cured pork jowl. If
      you can't find it, use pancetta, which is available at better
      supermarkets.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>4 Servings</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>
        115g thinly sliced guanciale (pancetta or unsmoked bacon can be used as
        substitutes)
      </li>
      <li>½ tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>½ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¾ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 400g cans of peeled tomatoes with juices, crushed by hand</li>
      <li>200g dried bucatini or spaghetti</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely grated Pecorino Romano (about 30g)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a Dutch oven or large heavy skillet over medium heat. Add
        guanciale and sauté until crisp and golden, about 4 minutes. Add pepper
        flakes and black pepper; stir for 10 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until soft, about 8 minutes.
        Add tomatoes, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        sauce thickens, 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season with salt; add the pasta
        and cook, stirring occasionally, until 2 minutes before al dente. Drain,
        reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add drained pasta to sauce in skillet and toss vigorously with tongs to
        coat. Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook until sauce coats
        pasta and pasta is al dente, about 2 minutes. (Add a little pasta water
        if sauce is too dry.) Stir in the Pecorino Romano and transfer pasta to
        warmed bowls.
